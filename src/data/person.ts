  headline: `
I am a Mobile Developer focused on building high-performance, cross-platform applications. At Magic Lane, I maintain a major consumer-facing app and work on the core SDK day to day.

My main focus is software architecture, Dart FFI and native C++ bindings. Most of my time goes into building the layer that connects low-level C++ logic with Dart and the mobile stack above it.

I like breaking down complex systems into modular, testable pieces and I treat clean architecture as the baseline for keeping things workable long-term. My strength is on the backend mobile side and SDK integration, but I hold UI work to the same structural standards.
