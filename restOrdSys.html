                    <h4 class="mb-2">ASP.NET CORE SERVER</h4>
                    <p>The server is structured following best practices regarding clean architecture, with a clear
                        separation between controllers, services and repositories. Dependencies between components
                        are based on interfaces, ensuring a high level of abstraction and flexibility. The system is
                        designed to be easily extendable, with the ability to add new features through plugins.</p>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The solution is elegantly divided into four key projects:<br>
                        <b>► Domain</b>, which acts as the backbone, housing interfaces for data repositories and
                        services, entities, and the event and transaction components. This project contains the
                        interfaces that are implemented in the other projects, ensuring a clear separation of
                        concerns.
                        Any developed plugin will have to depend on and implement interfaces from this project, witout
                        needing to depend on the Implementation project;<br>
                        <b>► Implementation</b>, where the magic happens with concrete implementations, database
                        management, controllers, authentication, real-time communication, and client
                        notification;<br>
                        <b>► TestImplementation</b>, ensuring reliability through unit tests for verifying
                        functionality;<br>
                        <b>► Main</b> the powerhouse entry point responsible for loading plugins and
                        kickstarting the system. This modular structure enhances code clarity and manageability
                        while
                        boosting flexibility, making the system robust, scalable, and easily extendable.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-2">FLUTTER CLIENT</h4>
                    <p>
                        The client application is organized into three packages:<br>
                        <b>► Domain</b>, containing interfaces for entities, data
                        repositories, and a messaging service;<br>
                        <b>► Implementation</b>, housing implementations for entities,
                        services, data repositories, and files needed for generating the API based on the OpenAPI
                        contract provided by the server, including a subpackage generated by OpenApiGenerator;<br>
                        <b>► UI</b> which includes graphical interface elements, the framework for dependency injection,
                        and the blocks that bridge the graphical interface and application logic. Notably, the UI
                        package is the only Flutter package in the application, while the others are Dart packages
                        without graphical interface framework classes.<br>

            <h2 class="text-light">The Plugin Architecture</h2>
            <p class="text-light">
                Plugin architecture is apattern that enables an application to be extended and customized
                through the addition of small, independent modules called plugins. This architecture promotes modularity
                and extensibility, allowing new features to be incorporated without altering the core system, thus
                enhancing flexibility and scalability. Plugins operate with well-defined interfaces, ensuring smooth
                interaction with the main application and other plugins, while dynamic loading capabilities allow these
                components to be added or removed at runtime.
                <br><br>

                Using DLL file loading at runtime, the server can load plugins that extend the system's
                functionality. These plugins can be developed independently and added to the system without
                recompiling the server. The server scans a specific folder for DLL files and loads them at
                runtime, making the system highly flexible and extensible. The plugins can be developed
                by third parties or by the system's owner, allowing for easy customization and adaptation.

            </p>
            <div class="row justify-content-between">
                <div class="col-md-5">

                    <p class="text-light text-center">Dynamic options available on the client injected by server plugin

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-7">
                    <p class="text-light">
                        This functionality is achieved by using the C# reflection mechanism, via the Assembly class.
                        The server scans the plugins folder for DLL files and loads them using the Assembly.LoadFile
                        method. The server then searches for classes that implement the IInjector interface and
                        creates instances of these classes. The IInjector interface defines some methods that take
                        the app's IServiceCollection as a parameter, allowing the plugins to register their
                        services and dependencies. This mechanism ensures that the plugins can inject their services
                        into the server's dependency injection container, making them available to the rest of the
                        system. It's possible to create and inject any type of components (Mapper, Persisters, Repos,
                        EventObservers, Controllers, etc.)
                        <br><br>


                        The modular architecture allows the creation of plugins that provide options displayed in the
                        client application. When an option is selected, it triggers an action on the server. These
                        options act as predefined endpoints created by the modules and callable from the client
                        application. This setup facilitates defining and implementing modules that add specific
                        functionalities, with each module offering one or more options shown in the user interface.
                        Activating an option prompts the client to request the server to execute a specific action,
                        enhancing the application's flexibility and extensibility.

                                multiple attribute groups and a group might be associated with multiple products;<br>
                                <b>► Attributes</b> - representing the attributes that can be associated with a
                                product, such as small, medium, large, rare, medium rare, etc. An attribute can be
                                associated with a single attribute group and a group might have multiple attributes;<br>
                                <b>► LocationGroups</b> - representing the groups of locations within the
                                restaurant such as the different rooms where customer serving might occur;<br>
                                <b>► Locations</b> - representing the locations within the restaurant, such as the

                                All menu related entities are being stored using temporal tables, ensuring that the

                                A finished order is composed of similar elements as an active order, but with the
                                addition of a flag signaling if the order was canceled. A finished order item does not
                                have the flags for statuses, as the order is already finished.<br><br>

                                The system is designed to be able to handle multiple orders at the same time, with the
