                    <p>A C++ implementation of a cheat for the classic Romanian word game, Fazan. With this program, players can gain an advantage by having access to a vast array of words at their fingertips. More often than not, the generated word will lock the next player. The program boasts a wide range of options, including toggle for word duplication, the ability to remove words said by opponents, the possibility to play with custom words and more.</p>
                    <p>Built on a custom directed multigraph data structure and a greedy algorithm, this program guarantees lightning-fast speed even with a massive set of words, including all Scrabble-accepted words in Romanian.</p>
                    <p>Not only is this software a great tool for gaining a decisive edge in the game, but it can also be used to generate the complete list of words used for blocking. Fun fact: you can link at least 49047 words in a single game of Fazan without closing off options for the next player or repeating a word.</p>
