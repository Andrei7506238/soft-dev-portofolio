                    <p style="color:white;">The app will be a secret partner to help the user master the FAZAN
                        word game. This tool will skillfully guide through each round, suggesting clever words,
                        destroying any possibility of opponents continuing.<br><br>


                        FAZAN is a popular word and strategy game in Romania, often used as an educational game for
                        learning
                        words and developing vocabulary. The game consists of determining strings of words that are
                        connected by the respective first and last two letters. The aim of the game is to block the
                        opponent
                        using words that cannot lead to other words.<br><br>

                        This is a Flutter implementation of the original C++ Fazan Cheat featured below, with a modern
                        and
                        user-friendly interface. The app is designed to be easy to use and accessible to all players,
                        providing a competitive edge in the game. The app is available for download on the Google Play
                        Store.

                    <p>A C++ implementation of a cheat for the classic Romanian word game, Fazan. With this program,
                        players can gain an advantage by having access to a vast array of words at their fingertips.
                        More often than not, the generated word will lock the next player. The program boasts a wide
                        range of options, including toggle for word duplication, the ability to remove words said by
                        opponents, the possibility to play with custom words and more.</p>
                    <p>Built on a custom directed multigraph data structure and a greedy algorithm, this program
                        guarantees lightning-fast speed even with a massive set of words, including all
                        Scrabble-accepted words in Romanian.</p>
                    <p>Not only is this software a great tool for gaining a decisive edge in the game, but it can
                        also
                        be used to generate the complete list of words used for blocking. Fun fact: you can link at
                        least 49047 words in a single game of Fazan without closing off options for the next player
                        or
                        repeating a word.</p>

                    <p>A movie catalog and recomandation system built using modern C++. The user interface is
                        intuitive
                        and user-friendly, providing a plethora of features such as movie rating, wishlist, and
                        favorite
                        functionality.</p>
                    <p>The solution comprises of multiple integrated components, including a logic and database
                        linkage
                        module powered by the sqlite_orm library, a visually appealing UI developed utilizing the Qt
                        framework, a robust testing module, and a Python-based AI recommendation system.</p>
                    <p>As a team member, I was primarily responsible for the implementation of the UI aspect of the
                        project as well for linking the "frontend" and "backend" projects, as part of our Modern C++
                        Artificial Intelligence college coursework.</p>
                    <p>Note: This is a team university project.</p>

                    <p>Our OpenGl C++ based game/tech demo showcases our technical and creative proficiency in
                        creating
                        modern 3D graphical systems. This project showcases a fish aquarium rendered in a modern,
                        aesthetically pleasing room.</p>
                    <p>The game features graphical techniques including 3D camera movement, Phong lighting and
                        shadowing, alpha blending of multiple translucide planes, dynamic billboards (e.g. bubbles
                        that
                        are always facing the camera). The fish movement is generated using parametric 3D equations,
                        providing realistic and dynamic movement.</p>
                    <p>As the captain of the team, I was primarily responsible for the most challenging aspects of
                        the
                        project, including the management and coordination of the team, as well as the
                        implementation of
                        the most complex features. The project was awarded one of the best demos.</p>
